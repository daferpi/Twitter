- Test started
- Project running
- Change heigth of tableview cell and also change the height of uilabel that contains the text
- Add new font type to body
- Modify font type in detail
- Problem to align images because the images not show for error in api call (is required fixed this error in test process?)
-  (here is required add some control flow to check when a call is not finished not execute a new call using a flag for example and add a label or a display that indicate that the data is loading)
- UI + API not complete in the time for the test. I can finish the test in the home and you can review the result. Here the developer must include a searchBar and SearchController in the code. The search controller execute the search when the text changes (here is possible to add some controls to validate that the search is only in execution when the user finish to enter the text). Is required implement a call whith the api similar to call to recover tweets using a string as parameter. When the call returns the result we display the data in table. The table can have 2 arrays one for the results of the search and other to the normal behaviour of the tweet list.
- Core data not complete in the time for the test. I have a stack of core data and i can complete the flow in home. Core data implementation required define a xcmodel file with the class that represents the model of the data and we need to save the data using the methods in core data stack. Also we need add one control to check if the application have connection or not to decide the location to recover the data to show in the table.

- With the navigationController i can not solve the problem to remove the black lines before and after the navigation bar and status bar. To show the navigation bar the navigation controller have a method that is hiddenNavigationBar and is required set to false and also add setTranslucent navigation bar to false but in this case not works.
I know that is possible move the view to remove this black bar, but i think that is not the right solution. I need to review this problem with more detail.

- To display the detail with navigation controller is required comment the line [self presentViewController:navigationVC animated:YES completion:nil]; in didSelectRowAtIndexPath and add [self.navigationController pushViewController:navigationVC animated:YES]; but i can not execute this because i need fixed the previous problem before.

/*************** after the test in home ********************/

- Fixed problem with navigation bar and tableview position
